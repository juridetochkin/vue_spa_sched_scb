## Everything you need for a complete Calendar solution.

QCalendar is a [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) component. It is a powerful calendar that plugs right into your Quasar application and allows for viewing of **day** (1-7 days for a week), **monthly**, **scheduler** and **agenda** views. Painstaking care has been given to make almost every aspect of QCalendar configurable and/or modifiable in some way and control given to the developer.

# QCalendar v4.0.0 Alpha
Welcome to the QCalendar v4.0.0 Alpha release

### QCalendar is now converted to use Vue v3
With this update comes a lot of changes, with over 90% of QCalendar being rewritten. Please read below to understand these changes and how they will affect you for upgrading.

> Until the final stable version is released, some aspects of the calendar may change. We're not planning for additional changes, but unforeseen reported issues may require us to do breaking changes (unlikely, but keep this in mind). So please make sure that you read each v4 alpha/beta version's release notes carefully before upgrading.
